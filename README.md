This lab guides you through the process of software installation required to build the Open Spatial Infrastructure weâ€™ll be using throughout the course. Instructions provided for Mac and Windows systems; Ubuntu also available upon request. All of the instructions following already assume you have an OS or Windows system running on your machine. You can also use a VirtualBox or Docker environment for your system.

- Identify core components of an open spatial infrastructure
- Initialize a spatial database successfully
