[Lab 1. Spatial Infrastructure Initialization, Part 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/136TaoPacD7U9zN7inn2NDcyu5UZXey2tu3J_spaF_J4/edit?usp=sharing)

This lab guides you through the process of software installation required to build the Open Spatial Infrastructure weâ€™ll be using throughout the course. Instructions provided for Mac and Windows systems; Ubuntu also available upon request. All of the instructions following already assume you have an OS or Windows system running on your machine. You can also use a VirtualBox or Docker environment for your system. 

By the end of this lab you will:
- Install software and packages from the command line
- Identify core components of an open spatial infrastructure
- Initialize a spatial database successfully
